I had a bit off extra time this week and did more than I expected/planned to do this week. But these advancement are crucial and hopefully I’ll slow it down a bit during the week of final exams at my university (which is just after the GSOC starts, so from 3.6.2017. to 8.6.2017.).  
  

### What I did this week:

- Published the project to github — https://github.com/dorianb96/Spark_EEG_Analysis
- Created the project structure and wrote a few unit tests
- Did some configuration on the server
- Implemented the EEGDataTransformer which can handle files from HDFS (Hadoop distributed file system)
- Started with the data loading process (OffLineDataProvider functionality)

  

### What I aim to do next week:

- Finish the data loading process (ie. functionality in the OffLineDataProvider class)

  

### Blocks:

- I had some questions for the original application developers, but they were quickly resolved
