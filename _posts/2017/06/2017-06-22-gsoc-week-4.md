This weekend I focused on implementing the full machine learning pipeline which means we can do everything from loading the EEG up-to giving the predicted responses.  

### What I did this week:

- Created the Classifier Interface
- Implemented the Logistic Regression classifier
- Wrote a test to test the classifier
- Replaced the previous JUnit TestRunner process with a JUnit Suite of tests which do not run concurrently and provide better output

### What I aim to do next week:

- Implement other classifiers
- Write the phase 1 evaluation
- Develop documentation of the code, look for possible code refactoring
- Plan the next phase: Workflow management

### Blocks:

- None
