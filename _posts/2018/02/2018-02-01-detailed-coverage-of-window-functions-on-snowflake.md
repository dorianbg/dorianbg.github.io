I've written a blog post on [sonra.io](https://sonra.io) covering window function features supported by Snowflake data warehouse.

I covered these topics:

- Aggregate and sequencing functions on Snowflake
- Analytical and statistical function on Snowflake
- Support for flexible frame definition
- Distinct inside window function
- LISTAGG - Aggregation into strings
- ARRAYS - Aggregation into arrays
- WINDOW CLAUSE - Clause for the WINDOW declaration
- UDAF - User-defined aggregate functions

You can find the blog post at this [link](https://sonra.io/2018/01/31/learn-window-functions-snowflake-become-cloud-data-warehouse-superhero/).
