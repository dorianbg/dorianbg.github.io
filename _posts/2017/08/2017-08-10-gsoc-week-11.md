This weekend I worked on improving the application. I managed to implement the configuration screens for DecisionTrees as well as Random Forests. The back-end configuration handlers were implemented as well. I also worked on improving the job tracking and started the deep learning/neaural network implementation.  
  

### What I did this week:

- Implemented DecisionTreeConfigScreen and RandomForestConfigScreen within EEG_WorkflowGUI project to allow the user to configure the mentioned classifier
- Implemented configuration handling for DecisionTree and RandomForest classifiers
- Added the log button which checks in real-time the logs of a job
- Fixed the job information segment of the JobTrackingPanel for classifiers which were loaded, now the implementation looks at historical logs for the correct information
- Created REST services for sending a list of saved classifies, getting the original configuration of a classifier which the user decided to save, added REST API for cancelling a job
- Developer basic IClassifier implementation of a neural network in the Spark_EEGAnalysis project

### What I aim to do next week:

- Finish the work on the neural network classifier 
- Test the application neural network classifier
- Try to install and configure kerberos on a local machine using docker and cloudera quickstart

### Blocks:

- Waiting on requirements definition for neural network/deep learning methods
