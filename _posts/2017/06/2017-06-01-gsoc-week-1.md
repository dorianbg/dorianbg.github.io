I worked on improving the code to match some quality standards my mentor advised. Mainly I added logging support instead of pure printing as well as changed the project structure.  
  

### What I did this week:

- Replaced print statements with logging procedures using Apache Logging/log4j
- Revisited some exceptions and added better handling via logging 
- Changed the default file license headers with a template
- Created a pull request for EEGLoader project with Hadoop Changes
- Replaced EEGLoader folder with JAR file stored in Local Maven repository
- Replaced the projects package structure

### What I aim to do next week:

- Next week I have final exams for this year so I won't be able to do much before Friday
- Explore workflow creation options

### Blocks:

- None
