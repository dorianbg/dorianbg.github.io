This weekend I worked on "polishing" the GUI, removing a couple of issues/bugs found in the application as well as further improve the whole application.  

  

### What I did this week:

- Adapted the layout to start with a File browser screen and have the analysis functionality as a button

- Settings panel can now be triggered from a menu bar so that you get rid of IntroJPanel

- Leading to previous two changes, I created a general screen to replace the limited functionality of three screens we previously had

- Allowed double click functionality to open a new window

- Created a Filtering text field within data browser

- Added settings into a menu and improve the response when settings are changed

- Fixed couple of bugs (JFileChooser, button functionality)

- Added a new look and feel

- Refactored the buttons panel to include more general functionality

### What I aim to do next week:

- add a shortcut for closing a window (control + w or escape)

- refactor the way settings are stored (use Java Preferences API)

- Fix JTable column width to be more flexible

- Update the Hadoop data model 

- develop and test a full JAR for all platforms

### Blocks:

- None
