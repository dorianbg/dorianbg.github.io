As the official coding period starts on 30th May 2017, this week was all about preparing the ground for future work.  
  

### What I did this week:

- Analyzed the EEG application we are trying to implement using distributed processing tools (Apache Hadoop, Apache Spark)
- Learned basics of EEG data and signal processing (discrete wavelet transforms)
- Created a local testing environment to mimic the production environment (server)
- Further tuned our computing cluster
- Configured Oozie (a workflow manager) to work correctly
- Wrote a quick guide on using Oozie

### What I aim to do next week:

- Implement EEG data loading capabilites from Hadoop Distributed file system (currently only normal file system is supported)
- Create a project on git(hub)
- Determine the project structure of the code

### Blocks:

- So far none, the infrastructure requirements were fulfilled extremely quickly and that could have been a potential block
