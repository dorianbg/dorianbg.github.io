This was the final weekend of Google summer of code. I am glad that we managed to deploy the application onto the server without any issues. I have also worked on writing good documentation and a proper project summary.  

### What I did this week:

- Wrote project documentation (readme.md and etc.)
- Wrote the project summary
- Finished deploying the application
- Fixed quite a few bugs in the application
- Explored possible progress tracking (atleast for neural network training using dl4j)
