I've recently read the "Advanced Python Mastery" course by David Beazley (can be found [here](https://github.com/dabeaz-course/python-mastery)).

While there is a lot of material, here are some things I'll try to incorporate more of:

#### 1) Use abstract base classes -> similar to interfaces

#### 2) Use handler classes -> composition over inheritance

#### 3) Function + callback pattern
