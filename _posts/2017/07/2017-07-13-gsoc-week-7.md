This weekend I worked a lot on the GUI, specifically on making the basic swing desktop application with 3 main screen (accessible via the introductory MainMenu screen).  
  
  

### What I did this week:

  

- Implemented a JPanel that allows the user adjust settings
- Made a json file which has the ability of loading/saving user settings 
- Improved the hadoop files loading time by creating an index of files
- Refactored a bit of code
- Added a JDialogBox for showing the progress of a file/directory copy
- Fixed the issues with change of settings and how they affect the program during run-time
- Refactor the complete of interacting with Hadoop HDFS into a single class (HadoopModel) which abstracts away methods such as data uploading, listing of files in a directory, managing the cache of Hadoop files for faster screen showing time and etc. 
- Improved the setting panel to adjust the setting at run-time
- Listened for feedback on the application and what aspects to improve (from my mentor)

  

  

### What I aim to do next week:

- Adapt the layout to start with a File browser screen and have the analysis functionality as a button
- Double click functionality opens a new window
- add a shortcut for closing a window (control + w)
- Settings page should be triggered from a menu bar so that you get rid of IntroJPanel
- Filtering capability within data browser
- Add settings into a menu and improve the response when settings are changed
- Fix couple of bugs
- JAR deployment
- Possibly refactor the Screen logic (layout and management of them)

### Blocks:

- None
