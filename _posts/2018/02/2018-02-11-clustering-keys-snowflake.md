I've written a blog post covering in depth the new **Clustering Keys** feature of Snowflake.

In the post I explained the internals of how clustering keys work in a Shared-Disk architecture of Snowflake and compared it to Redshift.

I also compared and analyzed the execution plans of queries that used clustering with those that didn't.

You can find the full blog post [here](https://sonra.io/2018/02/08/spacex-performance-snowflake-clustering-keys/).
