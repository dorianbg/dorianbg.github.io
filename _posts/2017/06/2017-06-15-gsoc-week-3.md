I had a very productive week managing to implement the feature engineering process using Discrete Wavelet transforms. I also made the according and will start working on classification procedure.  

### What I did this week:

- Create modular interface for signal processing and feature extraction
- Implement first signal processing methods (discrete wavelet transforms) using Apache Spark Resilient Distributed Dataset API (MapReduce framework)
- Tested the output of feature engineering process

### What I aim to do next week:

- Finsih testing the feature engineering output
- Start working on classification - implement the Classifer Interface and a basic classifier (logistic regression)
- Have a full pipeline from reading the data to predictions from a classifier

### Blocks:

- None
