I worked on finalizing the Data loading process this week which is a large stepping stone for further development.  

###   

### What I did this week:

- Fully implemented the capabilities of OffLineDataProvider class which reads EEG data from Hadoop but then processes that data in order to create 2D arrays with epochs of EEG signals
- Tested the implementation
- Refactored some code
- Wrote good documentation
- Changed the license/file headers of the source code

### What I aim to do next week:

- Implemenet good logging procedure
- Revisit the exception handling procedure
- change the package structure

### Blocks:

- I had some questions for the original application developers, but they were quickly resolved
