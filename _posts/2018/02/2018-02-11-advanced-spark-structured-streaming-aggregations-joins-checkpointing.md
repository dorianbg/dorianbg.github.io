I wrote a blog post demonstrating advanced Spark Structured Streaming topics.

An overview of the content is:

- setting up a Kafka server
- producing messages with Kafka
- consuming tweets with Spark Structured Streaming
- watermarking messages
- parsing JSON data
- performing aggregattion queries on the stream of data
- analyzing execution plans of queries
- upserting data to Snowflake
- checkpointing a structured stream
