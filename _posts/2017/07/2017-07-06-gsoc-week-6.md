This weekend I worked a lot on the GUI, specifically on making the basic swing desktop application with 3 main screen (accessible via the introductory MainMenu screen).  
  

### What I did this week:

- Created a JPanel that shows all files in users Hadoop home directory and allows the user to add or delete a user folder
- Created a JPanel that shows all files in directory of a single User and allows the user to add or delete a study folder
- Created a JPanel that shows all files in a single experiment and allows the user to add or delete a user folder
- Glued all the screens together to have a nice total workflow

### What I aim to do next week:

- Implement JPanel that allows the user adjust settings
- Add delete option to all stages
- Save settings in an external file
- Improve hadoop files loading time
- Refactor code
- Document code
- Add a JDialogBox for showing the progress of a file/directory copy

### Blocks:

- None
