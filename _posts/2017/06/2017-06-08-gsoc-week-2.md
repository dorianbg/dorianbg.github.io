I was relatively inactive this week as I had my final exams for this academic year on Tuesday, Thursday and Friday. I mainly focused on planning the future course of the project.  
  

### What I did this week:

- Improved project management by adding a project management "Kanban" board to the github project with an "Agile" to-do list of plans
- Explored workflow deployment possibilities
- Read about EEG signal processing methods (discrete wavelet transforms)

### What I aim to do next week:

- Create modular interface for signal processing and feature extraction
- Implement first signal processing methods (discrete wavelet transforms) using Apache Spark Resilient Distributed Dataset API (MapReduce framework)

### Blocks:

- None
