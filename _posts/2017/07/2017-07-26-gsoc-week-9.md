This weekend I finished the first part of the GUI Application which is concerned with managing files (listing, uploading, deleting, browsing). I managed to make a working JAR application (which turned into a lot of work), as well as fixed the apparent bugs. I have also added the method documentations and refactored/formatted/cleaned the code.  
  
  

### What I did this week:

- added a shortcut for closing a window using escape
- refactored the way settings are stored by now using the Java Preferences API
- update the Hadoop file model for faster responses
- developed a full JAR file tested on all platforms
- half finished with creating the Analysis panel (with Java Swing GUI)

### What I aim to do next week:

- finish the analysis pipeline from phase 1
- explored web development using Spring Boot
- built the skeleton of our web application
- explored dl4j options and define scope
- define the workflow and quey parameters the user will provide
- build the basic web server which can submit spark jobs built based on query parameters

  

### Blocks:

- None
