This weekend I focused on finishing the first part of the project (eeg data analysis pipeline) and making the user facing GUI. Regarding the GUI, this week was mainly for planning and I managed to create a skeleton architecture. During this week I also had to fill in the Phase 1 evaluations.  

### What I did this week:

- Implemented SVM,Random Forest and Gradient boosted tree classifiers
- Created hand-made prototype for the application
- Created the skeleton of the GUI application and uploaded it to a new github repository
- Implemented the initial screens of the application using Java Swing
- Created a plan for the next stage

### What I aim to do next week:

- Implement screen for creating new users and uploading new directories
- Test how to load data from Hadoop and see how to combat the likely lag because Hadoop server is on a remote server

### Blocks:

- None
